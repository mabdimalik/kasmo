# Kasmo Gacmeed Lexicon

Kasmo is a translation initiative to make AI concepts easier to understand and talk about in Somali. It grew from research and workshops on language, technology, and translation in East Africa.

This work is coordinated by Dr. Peter Chonka, Senior Lecturer in Global Digital Cultures at Kingâ€™s College London and Mohamed Abdimalik, founder of Jaantus.

Kasmo is still in early development. New translations, terms, and visuals will continue to grow through dialogue with educators, journalists, and civic groups.
